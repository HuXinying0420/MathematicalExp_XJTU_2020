# MathematicalExp_XJTU_2020

This repository contains the project reports for the Mathematical Modeling course during the summer term of 2020 at Xi'an Jiaotong University.

## Project List

1. **hw1_1: SARS Spread Prediction**
    - Predict the number of tourists in 2003 and compare it with real data to illustrate the impact of SARS on the city's tourism.
2. **hw1_2: Hospital Quality Assessment**
    - Use Topsis to quantitatively analyze the medical quality of a hospital over 5 years.
3. **hw2: Hill Cipher Encryption and Decryption**
    - Implement Hill cipher encryption and decryption.
4. **hw3: Optimal Design of Beverage Cans**
    - Calculate the most material-efficient design for beverage cans.
5. **hw6_1: Application of Regression Analysis in Mall Management**
    - Establish the relationship between sales and inventory capital, advertising expenses, and employee salaries.
6. **hw6_2: Alloy Strength and Carbon Content Relationship**
    - Use regression analysis for quantitative prediction of the relationship between alloy strength and carbon content.
